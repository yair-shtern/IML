    "# Lab 08 - Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous labs we fitted and analyzed different algorithms for different hypothesis classes. In many of those, the chosen hypothesis was the one minimizing some cost function $\\mathcal{F}_S\\left(h\\right)$ for some training set $S=\\left\\{\\left(\\mathbf{x}_i,y_i\\right)\\right\\}^m_{i=1}$, and where $\\mathcal{F}$ measures the goodness of $h$'s fit to $S$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Along side fitting a hypothesis, we have also discussed the richness and expressiveness of different hypothesis classes. For example, we have seen how the depth of a classification tree or the degree of a fitted polynomial influences prediction. We built the intuition of how the richness of the hypothesis class, through which the richness of the selected hypothesis, influences the bias-variance treade-off and the generalization error. \n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of **regularization** is of constraining the fitting process to enable the selection of complex models, but only if it is indeed \"justified enough\". Instead of minimizing only $\\mathcal{F}$ we introduce an additional **regularization term** that depends on the tested hypothesis. We are searching for hypotheses that minimized the joint expression $$ h_S = \\underset{h\\in\\mathcal{H}}{\\text{argmin}} \\,\\, \\mathcal{F}_S\\left(h\\right) + \\lambda \\mathcal{R}\\left(h\\right) $$  \n",
    "where we select $\\mathcal{R}$ in a way that measures the \"complexity\" of the hypothesis $h$. In this lab we focus on two modern regularization terms for regression: Lasso- and Ridge regressions."

Recall that the \"only\" difference between these two optimization problems is that Lasso uses the $\\ell_1$ norm as the regularization term. By doing so it introduces **sparsity** to the solutions. Similar to the Ridge regression coefficients are shrinked towards zero, but due to the sparsity, we are more likely to get coefficients of *exactly* zero.\n",

Notice that between the LS and Ridge models the overall size of the coefficients decreases. A similar outcome is seen between the LS and Lasso coefficients, with the difference that in the Lasso case many features are given a $0$ coefficient. In fact, only the `vs`, `cyl` and `wt` features are with non-zero coefficients. This shows how the Lasso regression also performs a type of feature selection."
